# CSI Conformance Testing

This document describes how to run CSI conformance tests against the
go-bpfman CSI driver using the official `csi-sanity` tool.

## Overview

The [csi-sanity](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/csi-test) tool tests CSI
drivers for compliance with the CSI specification. It connects to a running
driver via its Unix socket and exercises the gRPC API.

## Limitations

This CSI driver implements only the **Node** and **Identity** services for
ephemeral inline volumes. It does not implement the **Controller** service
because:

- Volumes are created on-demand when pods reference them
- No external provisioning or volume lifecycle management is needed
- The driver exposes pre-existing BPF maps, not dynamically provisioned storage

As a result, only Identity service tests pass fully. Node service tests fail
because `csi-sanity` expects a Controller service to create volumes before
testing Node operations.

## Prerequisites

Build the `csi-sanity` container image:

```bash
make docker-build-csi-sanity
```

## Running Tests

### Deploy the Driver

Ensure the driver is running in your cluster:

```bash
make bpfman-deploy
```

For kind clusters, load the csi-sanity image:

```bash
kind load docker-image csi-sanity:dev --name bpfman-deployment
```

### Run Identity Tests

Run the tests as a privileged pod with access to the CSI socket:

```bash
kubectl run csi-sanity --rm -it --restart=Never \
  --image=csi-sanity:dev \
  --overrides='{
    "spec": {
      "containers": [{
        "name": "csi-sanity",
        "image": "csi-sanity:dev",
        "imagePullPolicy": "IfNotPresent",
        "args": [
          "--csi.endpoint", "/var/lib/kubelet/plugins/csi.go-bpfman.io/csi.sock",
          "--ginkgo.focus", "Identity",
          "--ginkgo.v"
        ],
        "volumeMounts": [{
          "name": "plugin-dir",
          "mountPath": "/var/lib/kubelet/plugins/csi.go-bpfman.io"
        }],
        "securityContext": {
          "privileged": true
        }
      }],
      "volumes": [{
        "name": "plugin-dir",
        "hostPath": {
          "path": "/var/lib/kubelet/plugins/csi.go-bpfman.io",
          "type": "Directory"
        }
      }]
    }
  }'
```

Expected output:

```

```

### Run All Applicable Tests

To run all tests except those requiring Controller service, change the args:

```bash
"args": [
  "--csi.endpoint", "/var/lib/kubelet/plugins/csi.go-bpfman.io/csi.sock",
  "--ginkgo.skip", "Controller",
  "--ginkgo.v"
]
```

Note: Node service tests will still fail because `csi-sanity` uses a BeforeEach
hook that calls `ControllerGetCapabilities` to determine how to provision test
volumes.

## Test Results Summary

| Service  | Tests | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Identity | 3     | PASS   |
| Node     | 15    | SKIP (requires Controller) |
| Controller | 74  | SKIP (not implemented) |

## Why Node Tests Fail

The `csi-sanity` tool assumes the standard CSI workflow:

1. Controller creates a volume (`CreateVolume`)
2. Node stages the volume (`NodeStageVolume`)
3. Node publishes the volume (`NodePublishVolume`)

Our driver uses **ephemeral inline volumes** where:

1. Pod spec includes volume attributes inline
2. Kubelet calls `NodePublishVolume` directly
3. No Controller involvement needed

This is a valid CSI pattern (used by secrets-store-csi-driver, etc.) but
`csi-sanity` doesn't have a mode to test it.

## Alternative Testing

For ephemeral inline volume drivers, integration testing via actual pod
deployments is more meaningful than `csi-sanity`. See
[testing-stats-example.md](testing-stats-example.md) for the end-to-end test
workflow.
